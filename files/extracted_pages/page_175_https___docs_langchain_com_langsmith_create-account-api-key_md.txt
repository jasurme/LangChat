# Create an account and API key

To get started with LangSmith, you need to create an account. You can sign up for a free account in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com). LangSmith supports sign in with Google, GitHub, and email.

## API keys

LangSmith supports two types of API keys: Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens. Both types of tokens can be used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API, but they have different use cases.

For more details on Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens, refer to the [Administration overview page](/langsmith/administration-overview).

## Create an API key

To log traces and run evaluations with LangSmith, you will need to create an API key to authenticate your requests. API keys can be scoped to a set of [workspaces](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces), or the entire [organization](/langsmith/administration-overview#organizations).

To create either type of API key:

1. Navigate to the [Settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and scroll to the **API Keys** section.
2. For service keys, choose between an organization-scoped and workspace-scoped key. If the key is workspace-scoped, the workspaces must then be specified.

   Enterprise users are also able to [assign specific roles](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspace-roles-rbac) to the key, which adjusts its permissions.
3. Set the key's expiration; the key will become unusable after the number of days chosen, or never, if that is selected.
4. Click **Create API Key.**

 The API key will be shown only once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.

## Delete an API key

To delete an API key:

1. Navigate to the [Settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and scroll to the **API Keys** section.
2. Find the API key you need to delete from the table. Toggle **Personal** or **Service** as needed.
3. Select the trash icon  in the **Actions** column and confirm deletion. ## Configure the SDK You may set the following environment variables in addition to `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. This is only required if using the EU instance. `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com` This is only required for keys scoped to more than one workspace. `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=` ## Using API keys outside of the SDK See [instructions for managing your organization via API](/langsmith/manage-organization-by-api). ***  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/create-account-api-key.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).
