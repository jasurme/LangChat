# Feedback data format

 Before diving into this content, it might be helpful to read the following: * [Conceptual guide on tracing and feedback](/langsmith/observability-concepts) 

**Feedback** is LangSmith's way of storing the criteria and scores from evaluation on a particular trace or intermediate run (span). Feedback can be produced from a variety of ways, such as:

1. [Sent up along with a trace](/langsmith/attach-user-feedback) from the LLM application
2. Generated by a user in the app [inline](/langsmith/annotate-traces-inline) or in an [annotation queue](/langsmith/annotation-queues)
3. Generated by an automatic evaluator during [offline evaluation](/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application)
4. Generated by an [online evaluator](/langsmith/online-evaluations-llm-as-judge)

Feedback is stored in a simple format with the following fields:

| Field Name                 | Type     | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`                       | UUID     | Unique identifier for the record itself                                                                |
| `created_at`               | datetime | Timestamp when the record was created                                                                  |
| `modified_at`              | datetime | Timestamp when the record was last modified                                                            |
| `session_id`               | UUID     | Unique identifier for the experiment or tracing project the run was a part of                          |
| `run_id`                   | UUID     | Unique identifier for a specific run within a session                                                  |
| `key`                      | string   | A key describing the criteria of the feedback, e.g. `'correctness'`                                    |
| `score`                    | number   | Numerical score associated with the feedback key                                                       |
| `value`                    | string   | Reserved for storing a value associated with the score. Useful for categorical feedback.               |
| `comment`                  | string   | Any comment or annotation associated with the record. This can be a justification for the score given. |
| `correction`               | object   | Reserved for storing correction details, if any                                                        |
| `feedback_source`          | object   | Object containing information about the feedback source                                                |
| `feedback_source.type`     | string   | The type of source where the feedback originated, e.g. `'api'`, `'app'`, `'evaluator'`                 |
| `feedback_source.metadata` | object   | Reserved for additional metadata, currently                                                            |
| `feedback_source.user_id`  | UUID     | Unique identifier for the user providing feedback                                                      |

Here is an example JSON representation of a feedback record in the above format:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "created_at": "2024-05-05T23:23:11.077838",
  "modified_at": "2024-05-05T23:23:11.232962",
  "session_id": "c919298b-0af2-4517-97a2-0f98ed4a48f8",
  "run_id": "e26174e5-2190-4566-b970-7c3d9a621baa",
  "key": "correctness",
  "score": 1.0,
  "value": null,
  "comment": "I gave this score because the answer was correct.",
  "correction": null,
  "id": "62104630-c7f5-41dc-8ee2-0acee5c14224",
  "feedback_source": {
