# LangSmith docs

**LangSmith is a framework-agnostic platform for developing, debugging, and deploying AI agents and LLM applications.**
It helps you trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place. LangSmith works with any agent stack, whether you’re using an existing framework or building your own. Prototype locally, then move to production with integrated monitoring and evaluation to build more reliable AI agents.

## Get started

  Sign up at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) (no credit card required). You can log in with **Google**, **GitHub**, or **email**.   Go to your [Settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) → **API Keys** → **Create API Key**. Copy the key and save it securely.   LangSmith works with many frameworks and providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, CrewAI, Vercel AI SDK, Pydantic AI, and more. Browse [available integrations](/langsmith/integrations) to connect your stack. 

Once your account and API key are ready, choose a quickstart to begin building with LangSmith:

  Gain visibility into every step your application takes to debug faster and improve reliability.   Measure and track quality over time to ensure your AI applications are consistent and trustworthy.   Deploy your agents as Agent Servers, ready to scale in production. 

### More ways to build

  Use LangSmith in managed cloud, in a self-hosted environment, or hybrid to match your infrastructure and compliance needs.   Use a visual interface to design, test, and refine applications end-to-end.   Iterate on prompts with built-in versioning and collaboration to ship improvements faster.   Design and deploy AI agents visually with a no-code interface—perfect for rapid prototyping and getting started without writing code. 

 LangSmith meets the highest standards of data security and privacy with HIPAA, SOC 2 Type 2, and GDPR compliance. For more information, see the [Trust Center](https://trust.langchain.com/). 

## Workflow

LangSmith combines observability, evaluation, deployment, and platform setup in one integrated workflow—from local development to production.
