# Enable Insights

[Insights](/langsmith/insights) provides AI-powered analysis of your traces and application data within LangSmith. This page explains how to enable Insights on a [self-hosted LangSmith instance](/langsmith/self-hosted).

 Self-hosted LangSmith is an add-on to the Enterprise plan. For more details, refer to [Pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing). [Contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment. 

## Prerequisites

Before enabling Insights, you must complete the following setup steps:

1. Install the base LangSmith platform:
   * [Install on Kubernetes](/langsmith/kubernetes).
   * [Install on Docker](/langsmith/docker).
2. [Enable LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform) (agent deployment capabilities).

## Components

Insights consists of two main components:

* `agentBootstrap`: Job that deploys the LangSmith Deployment (agent) needed for Insights.
* `insightsAgent`: The main agent that will handle insights generation.

## Enable Insights

To enable Insights, add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml  theme={null}
backend:
  agentBootstrap:
    enabled: true

config:
  insights:
    enabled: true
    encryptionKey: "" ``` ### Generate an encryption key Insights requires a Fernet encryption key to securely store secrets. Generate one using Python: ```bash theme={null} python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())" ```  You can store the encryption key in a predefined Kubernetes secret using the `insights_encryption_key` parameter. See [Use an existing secret](/langsmith/self-host-using-an-existing-secret#parameters) for details.  ***  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/insights-self-hosted.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).
