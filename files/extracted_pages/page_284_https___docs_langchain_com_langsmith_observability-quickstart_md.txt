# Tracing quickstart

[*Observability*](/langsmith/observability-concepts) is a critical requirement for applications built with Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are non-deterministic, which means that the same prompt can produce different responses. This behavior makes debugging and monitoring more challenging than with traditional software.

LangSmith addresses this by providing end-to-end visibility into how your application handles a request. Each request generates a [*trace*](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces), which captures the full record of what happened. Within a trace are individual [*runs*](/langsmith/observability-concepts#runs), the specific operations your application performed, such as an LLM call or a retrieval step. Tracing runs allows you to inspect, debug, and validate your application’s behavior.

In this quickstart, you will set up a minimal [*Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) application and add tracing with LangSmith. You will:

1. Configure your environment.
2. Create an application that retrieves context and calls an LLM.
3. Enable tracing to capture both the retrieval step and the LLM call.
4. View the resulting traces in the LangSmith UI.

 If you prefer to watch a video on getting started with tracing, refer to the quickstart [Video guide](#video-guide). 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **A LangSmith account**: Sign up or log in at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com).
* **A LangSmith API key**: Follow the [Create an API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-api-key) guide.
* **An OpenAI API key**: Generate this from the [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

The example app in this quickstart will use OpenAI as the LLM provider. You can adapt the example for your app's LLM provider.

 If you're building an application with [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/overview) or [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview), you can enable LangSmith tracing with a single environment variable. Get started by reading the guides for tracing with [LangChain](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain) or tracing with [LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph). 

## 1. Create a directory and install dependencies

In your terminal, create a directory for your project and install the dependencies in your environment:

 ```bash Python theme={null} mkdir ls-observability-quickstart && cd ls-observability-quickstart python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install -U langsmith openai ``` ```bash TypeScript theme={null} mkdir ls-observability-quickstart-ts && cd ls-observability-quickstart-ts npm init -y npm install langsmith openai typescript ts-node npx tsc --init ``` 

## 2. Set up environment variables

Set the following environment variables:

* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or your LLM provider's API key)
* (optional) `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`: If your LangSmith API key is linked to multiple workspaces, set this variable to specify which workspace to use.

```bash  theme={null}
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="" export OPENAI_API_KEY="" export LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID="" ``` If you're using Anthropic, use the [Anthropic wrapper](/langsmith/trace-anthropic) to trace your calls. For other providers, use [the traceable wrapper](/langsmith/annotate-code#use-%40traceable-%2F-traceable).  To send traces to a specific project, use the [`LANGSMITH_PROJECT` environment variable](/langsmith/log-traces-to-project). If this is not set, LangSmith will create a default tracing project automatically on trace ingestion.  ## 3. Define your application You can use the example app code outlined in this step to instrument a RAG application. Or, you can use your own application code that includes an LLM call. This is a minimal RAG app that uses the OpenAI SDK directly without any LangSmith tracing added yet. It has three main parts: * **Retriever function**: Simulates document retrieval that always returns the same string. * **OpenAI client**: Instantiates a plain OpenAI client to send a chat completion request. * **RAG function**: Combines the retrieved documents with the user’s question to form a system prompt, calls the `chat.completions.create()` endpoint with `gpt-4.1-mini`, and returns the assistant’s response. Add the following code into your app file (e.g., `app.py` or `app.ts`):  ```python Python theme={null} from openai import OpenAI def retriever(query: str): # Minimal example retriever return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"] # OpenAI client call (no wrapping yet) client = OpenAI() def rag(question: str) -> str: docs = retriever(question) system_message = ( "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + "\n".join(docs) ) # This call is not traced yet resp = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4.1-mini", messages=[ {"role": "system", "content": system_message}, {"role": "user", "content": question}, ], ) return resp.choices[0].message.content if __name__ == "__main__": print(rag("Where did Harrison work?")) ``` ```typescript TypeScript theme={null} import "dotenv/config"; import OpenAI from "openai"; // Minimal example retriever function retriever(query: string): string[] { return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]; } // OpenAI client call (no wrapping yet) const client = new OpenAI(); async function rag(question: string) { const docs = retriever(question); const systemMessage = "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + docs.join("\n"); // This call is not traced yet const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: "gpt-4.1-mini", messages: [ { role: "system", content: systemMessage }, { role: "user", content: question }, ], }); return resp.choices[0].message?.content; } (async () => { console.log(await rag("Where did Harrison work?")); })(); ```  ## 4. Trace LLM calls To start, you’ll trace all your OpenAI calls. LangSmith provides wrappers: * Python: [`wrap_openai`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/wrappers/langsmith.wrappers._openai.wrap_openai) * TypeScript: [`wrapOpenAI`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/js/functions/wrappers_openai.wrapOpenAI) This snippet wraps the OpenAI client so that every subsequent model call is logged automatically as a traced child run in LangSmith. 1. Include the highlighted lines in your app file:  ```python Python highlight={2,7} theme={null} from openai import OpenAI from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai # traces openai calls def retriever(query: str): return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"] client = wrap_openai(OpenAI()) # log traces by wrapping the model calls def rag(question: str) -> str: docs = retriever(question) system_message = ( "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + "\n".join(docs) ) resp = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4.1-mini", messages=[ {"role": "system", "content": system_message}, {"role": "user", "content": question}, ], ) return resp.choices[0].message.content if __name__ == "__main__": print(rag("Where did Harrison work?")) ``` ```typescript TypeScript highlight={3,9} theme={null} import "dotenv/config"; import OpenAI from "openai"; import { wrapOpenAI } from "langsmith/wrappers"; // traces openai calls function retriever(query: string): string[] { return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]; } const client = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI()); // log traces by wrapping the model calls async function rag(question: string) { const docs = retriever(question); const systemMessage = "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + docs.join("\n"); const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: "gpt-4.1-mini", messages: [ { role: "system", content: systemMessage }, { role: "user", content: question }, ], }); return resp.choices[0].message?.content; } (async () => { console.log(await rag("Where did Harrison work?")); })(); ```  2. Call your application:  ```bash Python theme={null} python app.py ``` ```bash TypeScript theme={null} npx ts-node app.ts ```  You'll receive the following output: ``` Harrison worked at Kensho. ``` 3. In the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **default** Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in [Step 2](#2-set-up-environment-variables)). You'll see the OpenAI call you just instrumented.

 ## 5. Trace an entire application You can also use the `traceable` decorator for [Python](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/run_helpers/langsmith.run_helpers.traceable) or [TypeScript](https://langsmith-docs-bdk0fivr6-langchain.vercel.app/reference/js/functions/traceable.traceable) to trace your entire application instead of just the LLM calls. 1. Include the highlighted code in your app file:  ```python Python highlight={3,10} theme={null} from openai import OpenAI from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai from langsmith import traceable def retriever(query: str): return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"] client = wrap_openai(OpenAI()) # keep this to capture the prompt and response from the LLM @traceable def rag(question: str) -> str: docs = retriever(question) system_message = ( "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + "\n".join(docs) ) resp = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4.1-mini", messages=[ {"role": "system", "content": system_message}, {"role": "user", "content": question}, ], ) return resp.choices[0].message.content if __name__ == "__main__": print(rag("Where did Harrison work?")) ``` ```typescript TypeScript highlight={3,11} theme={null} import "dotenv/config"; import OpenAI from "openai"; import { wrapOpenAI, traceable } from "langsmith/wrappers"; function retriever(query: string): string[] { return ["Harrison worked at Kensho"]; } const client = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI()); // keep this to capture the prompt and response from the LLM const rag = traceable(async (question: string) => { const docs = retriever(question); const systemMessage = "Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\n" + docs.join("\n"); const resp = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: "gpt-4.1-mini", messages: [ { role: "system", content: systemMessage }, { role: "user", content: question }, ], }); return resp.choices[0].message?.content; }); (async () => { console.log(await rag("Where did Harrison work?")); })(); ```  2. Call the application again to create a run:  ```bash Python theme={null} python app.py ``` ```bash TypeScript theme={null} npx ts-node app.ts ```  3. Return to the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com), navigate to the **default** Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in [Step 2](#2-set-up-environment-variables)). You'll find a trace of the entire app pipeline with the **rag** step and the **ChatOpenAI** LLM call.
