# Document API authentication in OpenAPI

This guide shows how to customize the OpenAPI security schema for your LangSmith API documentation. A well-documented security schema helps API consumers understand how to authenticate with your API and even enables automatic client generation. See the [Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide](/langsmith/auth) for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.

 **Implementation vs Documentation** This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth). 

This guide applies to all LangSmith deployments (Cloud and self-hosted). It does not apply to usage of the LangGraph open source library if you are not using LangSmith.

## Default schema

The default security scheme varies by deployment type:

 

By default, LangSmith requires a LangSmith API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```yaml  theme={null}
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-api-key
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []
```

When using one of the LangGraph SDK's, this can be inferred from environment variables.

 

By default, self-hosted deployments have no security scheme. This means they are to be deployed only on a secured network or with authentication. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).

## Custom security schema

To customize the security schema in your OpenAPI documentation, add an `openapi` field to your `auth` configuration in `langgraph.json`. Remember that this only updates the API documentation - you must also implement the corresponding authentication logic as shown in [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).

Note that LangSmith does not provide authentication endpoints - you'll need to handle user authentication in your client application and pass the resulting credentials to the LangGraph API.

  ```json theme={null} { "auth": { "path": "./auth.py:my_auth", // Implement auth logic here "openapi": { "securitySchemes": { "OAuth2": { "type": "oauth2", "flows": { "implicit": { "authorizationUrl": "https://your-auth-server.com/oauth/authorize", "scopes": { "me": "Read information about the current user", "threads": "Access to create and manage threads" } } } } }, "security": [ {"OAuth2": ["me", "threads"]} ] } } } ```   ```json theme={null} { "auth": { "path": "./auth.py:my_auth", // Implement auth logic here "openapi": { "securitySchemes": { "apiKeyAuth": { "type": "apiKey", "in": "header", "name": "X-API-Key" } }, "security": [ {"apiKeyAuth": []} ] } } } ``` 

## Testing

After updating your configuration:

1. Deploy your application
2. Visit `/docs` to see the updated OpenAPI documentation
3. Try out the endpoints using credentials from your authentication server (make sure you've implemented the authentication logic first)
