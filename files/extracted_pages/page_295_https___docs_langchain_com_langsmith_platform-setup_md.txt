# Set up LangSmith

This section covers how to host and manage LangSmith infrastructure. You can set up LangSmith for [observability](/langsmith/observability), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), and [prompt engineering](/langsmith/prompt-engineering), or use the full platform experience with [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) to also deploy and manage your applications through the UI.

 **Start here if you're setting up or maintaining LangSmith infrastructure.** If you want to deploy an agent application, the [Deployment section](/langsmith/deployments) covers application structure and deployment configuration. 

## Choose how to set up LangSmith

You can deploy LangSmith in one of three modes:

* [**Cloud**](/langsmith/cloud): fully managed by LangChain
* [**Hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid): LangChain manages the control plane; you host the data plane
* [**Self-hosted**](/langsmith/self-hosted): you manage the full stack within your infrastructure

  Fully managed observability, evaluation, prompt engineering, and application deployment. Deploy from GitHub with automated CI/CD.   **(Enterprise)** Observability, evaluation, prompt engineering, and application deployment with your applications running in your infrastructure.   **(Enterprise)** Full control with observability, evaluation, and prompt engineering. Enable the full platform experience with LangSmith Deployment or run standalone servers.
