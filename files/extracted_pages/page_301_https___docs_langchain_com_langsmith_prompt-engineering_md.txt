# Prompt engineering

The following sections help you create, manage, and optimize your prompts:

  Read definitions and key terminology for prompt engineering in LangSmith.   Build prompts via the UI or SDK, configure settings, use tools, add multimodal inputs, and connect model providers.   Organize with tags, commit changes, trigger webhooks, and share through the public prompt hub.   Browse and manage prompt tags and discover community prompts from the LangChain Hub.   Test and experiment with prompts using custom endpoints and model configurations.   Learn step-by-step techniques, like optimizing classifiers and advanced prompt engineering. 

 Use **[Polly](/langsmith/polly)** in the Prompt Playground to optimize prompts, generate tools, and create output schemas with AI-powered assistance. 

 To set up a LangSmith instance, visit the [Platform setup section](/langsmith/platform-setup) to choose between cloud, hybrid, or self-hosted. All options include observability, evaluation, prompt engineering, and deployment.
