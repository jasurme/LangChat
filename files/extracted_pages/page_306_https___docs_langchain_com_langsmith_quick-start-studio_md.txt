# Get started with Studio

[Studio](/langsmith/studio) in the [LangSmith Deployment UI](https://smith.langchain.com) supports connecting to two types of graphs:

* Graphs deployed on [cloud or self-hosted](#deployed-graphs).
* Graphs running locally with [Agent Server](#local-development-server).

## Deployed graphs

Studio is accessed in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com) from the **Deployments** navigation.

For applications that are [deployed](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart), you can access Studio as part of that deployment. To do so, navigate to the deployment in the UI and select **Studio**.

This will load Studio connected to your live deployment, allowing you to create, read, and update the [threads](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#threads), [assistants](/langsmith/assistants), and [memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory) in that deployment.

## Local development server

### Prerequisites

To test your application locally using Studio:

* Follow the [local application quickstart](/langsmith/local-server) first.
* If you don't want data [traced](/langsmith/observability-concepts#traces) to LangSmith, set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=false` in your application's `.env` file. With tracing disabled, no data leaves your local server.

### Setup

1. Install the [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli):

    ```bash pip theme={null} pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]" langgraph dev ``` ```bash uv theme={null} uv add "langgraph-cli[inmem]" langgraph dev ``` ```bash npm theme={null} npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev ``` 

    **Browser Compatibility** Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel. You'll need to manually add the tunnel URL to allowed origins by clicking **Connect to a local server** in the Studio UI. See the [troubleshooting guide](/langsmith/troubleshooting-studio#safari-connection-issues) for steps. 

   This will start the Agent Server locally, running in-memory. The server will run in watch mode, listening for and automatically restarting on code changes. Read this [reference](/langsmith/cli#dev) to learn about all the options for starting the API server.

   You will see the following logs:

   ```
   > Ready!
   >
   > - API: [http://localhost:2024](http://localhost:2024/)
   >
   > - Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs
   >
   > - LangSmith Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
   ```

   Once running, you will automatically be directed to Studio.

2. For a running server, access the Dbugger with one of the following:

   1. Directly navigate to the following URL: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.
   2. Navigate to **Deployments** in the UI, click the **Studio** button on a deployment, enter `http://127.0.0.1:2024` and click **Connect**.

   If running your server at a different host or port, update the `baseUrl` to match.

### (Optional) Attach a debugger

For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection, run the following:

 ```bash pip theme={null} # Install debugpy package pip install debugpy # Start server with debugging enabled langgraph dev --debug-port 5678 ``` ```bash uv theme={null} # Install debugpy package uv add debugpy # Start server with debugging enabled langgraph dev --debug-port 5678 ``` 

Then attach your preferred debugger:

  Add this configuration to `launch.json`: ```json theme={null} { "name": "Attach to LangGraph", "type": "debugpy", "request": "attach", "connect": { "host": "0.0.0.0", "port": 5678 } } ```   1. Go to Run → Edit Configurations 2. Click + and select "Python Debug Server" 3. Set IDE host name: `localhost` 4. Set port: `5678` (or the port number you chose in the previous step) 5. Click "OK" and start debugging 

 For issues getting started, refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/langsmith/troubleshooting-studio).
