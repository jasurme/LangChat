# Interact with your self-hosted instance of LangSmith

This guide will walk you through the process of using your self-hosted instance of LangSmith.

 This guide assumes you have already deployed a self-hosted LangSmith instance. If you have not, please refer to the [kubernetes deployment guide](/langsmith/kubernetes) or the [docker deployment guide](/langsmith/docker). 

### Configuring the application you want to use with LangSmith

LangSmith has a single API for interacting with both the hub and the LangSmith backend.

1. Once you have deployed your instance, you can access the LangSmith UI at `http(s)://`. 2. The LangSmith API will be available at `http(s):///api/v1` 3. The LangSmith Control Plane will be available at `http(s):///api-host` To use the API of your instance, you will need to set the following environment variables in your application: ```bash theme={null} LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=http:///api/v1 LANGSMITH_API_KEY=foo # Set to a legitimate API key if using OAuth ``` You can also configure these variables directly in the LangSmith SDK client: ```python theme={null} import langsmith langsmith_client = langsmith.Client( api_key='', api_url='http(s):///api/v1', ) ``` After setting the above, you should be able to run your code and see the results in your self-hosted instance. We recommend running through the [*quickstart guide*](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/#quick-start) to get a feel for how to use LangSmith. ### Self-Signed certificates If you are using self-signed certificates for your self-hosted LangSmith instance, this can be problematic as Python comes with its own set of trusted certificates, which may not include your self-signed certificate. To resolve this, you may need to use something like `truststore` to load system certificates into your Python environment. You can do this like so: 1. pip install truststore (or similar depending on the package manager you are using) Then use the following code to load the system certificates: ```python theme={null} import truststore truststore.inject_into_ssl() # The rest of your code import langsmith langsmith_client = langsmith.Client( api_key='', api_url='http(s):///api/v1', ) ``` *** ## API reference To access the API reference, navigate to `http:///api/docs` in your browser. ***  [Edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/edit/main/src/langsmith/self-host-usage.mdx) or [file an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new/choose).
