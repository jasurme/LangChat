# Contributing

**Welcome! Thank you for your interest in contributing.**

LangChain has helped form the largest developer community in generative AI, and we're always open to new contributors. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or sharing feedback, your involvement helps make LangChain and LangGraph better for everyone 🦜❤️

## Ways to contribute

  Found a bug? Please help us fix it by following these steps:   Check if the issue already exists in our GitHub Issues for the respective repo:  Issues Issues Issues    If no issue exists, create a new one. When writing, be sure to follow the template provided and to include a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Attach any relevant labels to the final issue once created. If a project maintainer is unable to reproduce the issue, it is unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.   A project maintainer will triage the issue and may ask for additional information. Please be patient as we manage a high volume of issues. Do not bump the issue unless you have new information to provide.   If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single topic. If two issues are related, or blocking, please [link them](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) rather than combining them. For example, ```text theme={null} This issue is blocked by #123 and related to #456. ```   Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement?   Search the issues for the respective repository for existing feature requests:  Issues Issues Issues    If no requests exist, start a new discussion under the [relevant category](https://forum.langchain.com/c/help/langchain/13) so that project maintainers and the community can provide feedback.   Be sure to describe the use case and why it would be valuable to others. If possible, provide examples or mockups where applicable. Outline test cases that should pass.     Documentation improvements are always welcome! We strive to keep our docs clear and comprehensive, and your perspective can make a big difference. Guide   With a large userbase, it can be hard for our small team to keep up with all the feature requests and bug fixes. If you have the skills and time, we would love your help! Guide If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself or ask a maintainer to do so. This helps avoid duplicate work. If you are looking for something to work on, check out the issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" in our repos:  Labels Labels Labels    Guide to adding a new LangChain integration 

## Acceptable uses of LLMs

Generative AI can be a useful tool for contributors, but like any tool should be used with critical thinking and good judgement.

We encourage contributors to use AI tools efficiently where they help. However, AI assistance must be paired with meaningful human intervention, judgement, and contextual understanding. **If the human effort required to create a pull request is less than the effort required for maintainers to review it, that contribution should not be submitted.**

We struggle when contributors' entire work (code changes, documentation updates, pull request descriptions) are LLM-generated. These drive-by contributions often mean well but miss the mark in terms of contextual relevance, accuracy, and quality. Mass automated contributions like these represent a denial-of-service attack on our human effort.

**We will close pull requests and issues that appear to be low-effort, AI-generated spam.**

With great tools comes great responsibility.
