# Google integrations

> Integrate with Google using LangChain JavaScript.

LangChain provides integrations with [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) through the `@langchain/google` package.

 Looking for the older `@langchain/google-genai` or `@langchain/google-vertexai` packages? They are maintained under [long-term support](#legacy-packages) but are no longer recommended for new projects. 

## Chat models

The [`ChatGoogle`](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/google) class is the recommended way to access Gemini models (such as `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `gemini-3-pro-preview`) and open models like Gemma. It supports both Google AI Studio and Vertex AI in a single interface

 See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install). 

 ```bash npm theme={null} npm install @langchain/google @langchain/core ``` ```bash yarn theme={null} yarn add @langchain/google @langchain/core ``` ```bash pnpm theme={null} pnpm add @langchain/google @langchain/core ``` 

Configure your API key:

```bash  theme={null}
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

```typescript  theme={null}
import { ChatGoogle } from "@langchain/google";

const model = new ChatGoogle("gemini-2.5-flash");

const res = await model.invoke([
  ["human", "What would be a good company name for a company that makes colorful socks?"],
]);
```

`ChatGoogle` supports tool calling, structured output, multimodal inputs (images, audio, video), reasoning/thinking, image generation, text-to-speech, and Gemini-specific native tools like Google Search grounding and code execution.

  Full chat model documentation, including setup, invocation, streaming, structured output, and more.   Google Search, Code Execution, URL Context, Google Maps, File Search, Computer Use, and MCP servers. 

### Third-party models on Vertex AI

[Anthropic](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/anthropic) Claude models are also available through
the [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude)
platform. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-claude)
for more information about enabling access to the models and the model names to use.

## Vector stores

### Vertex AI vector search

> [Vertex AI Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview),
> formerly known as Vertex AI Matching Engine, provides the industry's leading high-scale
> low latency vector database. These vector databases are commonly
> referred to as vector similarity-matching or an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) service.

```typescript  theme={null}
import { MatchingEngine } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/googlevertexai";
```

### Postgres vector store

The [PostgresVectorStore](/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores/google_cloudsql_pg) module from the
[`@langchain/google-cloud-sql-pg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/google-cloud-sql-pg) package provides a way to use CloudSQL for PostgreSQL to store
vector embeddings.

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @langchain/google-cloud-sql-pg
```

## Community tools

Google-related community tools are available in the `@langchain/community` package:

* [Google Calendar](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_calendar)
* [Gmail](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_gmail)
* [Google Places](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_places)
* [Google Routes](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_routes)
* [Google Scholar](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_scholar)
* [Google Trends](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/google_trends)

## Legacy packages

The following packages are maintained under long-term support for existing users. New projects should use `@langchain/google` instead.

### `@langchain/google-genai`

The `@langchain/google-genai` package provides [`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/google_generative_ai) for accessing Gemini models through Google AI Studio. This package is built on a deprecated Google SDK and will not receive new features.

### `@langchain/google-vertexai`

The `@langchain/google-vertexai` package provides [`ChatVertexAI`](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/google_vertex_ai) for accessing Gemini models through Vertex AI. This package is superseded by the Vertex AI support built into `@langchain/google`.

### `@langchain/google-common`

The `@langchain/google-common` package contains shared abstractions used internally by the Google integration packages. It is not intended to be used directly.

 To migrate from `@langchain/google-genai` or `@langchain/google-vertexai` to `@langchain/google`, see the [ChatGoogle](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/google) page for setup instructions. The `ChatGoogle` class provides equivalent functionality with unified access to both Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.
