# Retriever integrations

> Integrate with retrievers using LangChain JavaScript.

A [retriever](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval) is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query.
It is more general than a vector store.
A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them.

Retrievers accept a string query as input and return a list of `Document` objects.

For specifics on how to use retrievers, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval).

Note that all [vector stores](/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores) can be [cast to retrievers](/oss/javascript/langchain/retrieval).
Refer to the vector store [integration docs](/oss/javascript/integrations/vectorstores/) for available vector store retrievers.

## All retrievers
