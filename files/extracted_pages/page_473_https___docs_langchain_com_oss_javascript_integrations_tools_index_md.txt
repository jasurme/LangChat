# Tool integrations

> Integrate with tools using LangChain JavaScript.

[Tools](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools) are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A [toolkit](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools#toolkits) is a collection of tools meant to be used together.

## Integration platforms

The following platforms provide access to multiple tools and services through a unified interface:

| Tool/Toolkit                                            | Number of Integrations | Pricing             | Key Features                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Composio](/oss/javascript/integrations/tools/composio) | 500+                   | Free tier available | OAuth handling, event-driven workflows, multi-user support |

## All tools and toolkits
