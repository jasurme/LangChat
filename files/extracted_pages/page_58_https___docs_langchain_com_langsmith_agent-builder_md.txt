# LangSmith Agent Builder

> Create helpful AI agents without code. Start from a template, connect your accounts, and let the agent handle routine work while you stay in control.

## What you can do

* Automate everyday tasks like drafting emails, summarizing updates, and organizing information.
* Connect your favorite apps to bring context into your agent's work.
* Use in chat or where you work (e.g., Slack) to get help in the flow.
* Stay in control with simple approvals for important actions.

## Start building

  Pick a ready-made starter (e.g., email assistant or team updates) and customize.   Describe your goal in plain English and let AI draft your agent's configuration. Review and edit before running. 

## Get started

  Sign up for a [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/agents?skipOnboarding=true).   Start from a ready-to-use template, or describe your goal and let AI draft your agent's instructions. You can edit details before running. [Browse templates](https://www.langchain.com/templates).   Securely sign in to the services you want the agent to use.   Run the agent and iterate on its instructions in a few clicks.
