# Tool integrations

> Integrate with tools using LangChain Python.

[Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) are utilities designed to be called by a model: their inputs are designed to be generated by models, and their outputs are designed to be passed back to models.

A toolkit is a collection of tools meant to be used together.
