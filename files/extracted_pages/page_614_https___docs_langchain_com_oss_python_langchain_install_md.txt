# Install LangChain

To install the LangChain package:

 ```bash pip theme={null} pip install -U langchain # Requires Python 3.10+ ``` ```bash uv theme={null} uv add langchain # Requires Python 3.10+ ``` 

LangChain provides integrations to hundreds of LLMs and thousands of other integrations. These live in independent provider packages.

 ```bash pip theme={null} # Installing the OpenAI integration pip install -U langchain-openai # Installing the Anthropic integration pip install -U langchain-anthropic ``` ```bash uv theme={null} # Installing the OpenAI integration uv add langchain-openai # Installing the Anthropic integration uv add langchain-anthropic ``` 

 See the [Integrations tab](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for a full list of available integrations. 

Now that you have LangChain installed, you can get started by following the [Quickstart guide](/oss/python/langchain/quickstart).
