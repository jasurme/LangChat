# Built-in tools

You can access a variety of tools in Agent Builder. Use built-in tools to give your agents access to email, calendars, chat, project management, code hosting, spreadsheets/BI, search, social, and general web utilities.

 Google, Slack, Linear, GitHub, and LinkedIn use OAuth. Exa, Tavily, Pylon, and Twitter/X use workspace secrets (API keys).
